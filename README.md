## 🔧 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning: Missing value imputation (Age, Fare, Embarked)
- Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding for categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Model Training:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Model Tuning: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- Evaluation: Accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score

## Basic Concepts

1. Logistic Regression
-Type: Linear Classification Model

-Purpose: Estimates the probability of survival using a logistic (sigmoid) function.

-Test Accuracy: 81.0%

-Strengths: Simple, interpretable, fast to train.

2. Decision Tree Classifier
-Type: Tree-based Model

-Purpose: Splits data based on feature thresholds to make survival predictions.

-Test Accuracy: 78.2%

-Strengths: Handles non-linear data well, easy to visualize.

3. Random Forest Classifier
-Type: Ensemble of Decision Trees

-Purpose: Averages multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve performance.

-Test Accuracy: 82.1%

-Strengths: Better generalization, handles both numerical and categorical data.

4. Random Forest (GridSearch Optimized)
-Type: Hyperparameter-Tuned Random Forest

-Purpose: Uses GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

-Cross-Validation Accuracy: 83.5%

-Best Params: n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, min_samples_split=2

-Strengths: Improved performance and generalization by fine-tuning.
